Execute these tasks one by one. DO NOT START A NEW TASK UNTIL THE PREVIOUS ONE IS DONE.


When starting a new task, read this file again, since the human might have changed it. 

Mark all tasks with WIP when started and [COMPLETE] When done.

Do not stop while there are still tasks to do. 

You can modify this file too. If a task is complex break it up into subtask and write those here.

We are turning this into a minigame.

Tasks:

 - [COMPLETE] Let player drive the boat

 - [COMPLETE] Make the boat have a tow wire that is towing a barge full of gorillas

- [COMPLETE] Fix the controls, they are inverted (forwards goes backwards)

- [COMPLETE] Make the map much much larger, so the player can explore various islands.
